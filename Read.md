The Car Management System is a Java program that manages information about cars using two separate classes, Car and CarManagement. The Car class represents individual cars with attributes like make, model, year, color, price, and registration number. The CarManagement class includes functionalities to filter and manage cars based on specific criteria, such as brand, model, year, and price. The program allows users to save lists of cars meeting various criteria to separate files. It provides a flexible way to store and organize information about cars.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, file I/O, and data management, making it useful for tasks such as filtering, sorting, and exporting data for a car dealership or inventory management system.
